# Equity Price Target Evaluation Framework

## Overview

This document outlines a structured, disciplined approach to evaluate whether a given price target for any equity—whether above or below today's market price and over a horizon of up to five years—is reasonable.

---

## 1. Clarify the Parameters

- ✅ **Current Price (P₀)**: Note today's market price
- ✅ **Target Price (Pₜ)**: Record the proposed price target and whether it implies upside or downside
- ✅ **Time Horizon (T)**: Define the exact horizon (e.g., six months, two years, five years)
- 🔄 **Assumptions & Scope**: Determine whether forecasts should be conservative or aggressive, whether dividends are in scope, and whether share count is expected to change (buybacks, dilution)

## 2. Macro & Industry Context

- ✅ **Economic Cycle**: Assess where the economy is in the cycle (expansion, peak, downturn, recovery) and its likely path over T
- ✅ **Interest Rates & Inflation**: Incorporate forecasts for rates and inflation, since they drive discount rates and consumer/business behavior
- 🔄 **Regulatory & Geopolitical Factors**: Identify any pending regulatory changes or geopolitical risks that could materially affect the industry
- 🔄 **Industry Life-Cycle & Competitive Dynamics**: Map the company's industry to a life-cycle stage (growth, maturity, decline) and evaluate competitive intensity (Porter's Five Forces)

## 3. Fundamental Analysis

- ✅ **Historical Financials**: Compile at least 3–5 years of revenue, EBITDA, free cash flow (FCF), margins, and balance-sheet metrics
- 🔄 **Growth Drivers & Sustainability**: Project revenue growth drivers—new products, markets, pricing power—and test assumptions against past performance and peer benchmarks
- ⚠️ **Profitability & Capital Efficiency**: Analyze historical and forecasted margins, return on invested capital (ROIC) versus cost of capital (WACC), and working-capital trends
- 🤖 **Balance-Sheet Health**: Check leverage ratios (Debt/EBITDA, Debt/Equity), liquidity (current ratio), and covenants; model how they evolve under stress scenarios

## 4. Valuation Modeling

### 4.1 Discounted Cash-Flow (DCF)

- ✅ **Forecast unlevered FCF** over an explicit period (usually 5–10 years)
- 🔄 **Terminal Value**: Choose an appropriate terminal-value methodology (Gordon Growth vs. Exit Multiple)
- 🔄 **WACC Estimation**: Incorporate current risk-free rate, equity risk premium, beta, and cost of debt
- 🔄 **Intrinsic Value**: Derive intrinsic equity value and implied per-share price, then compare to Pₜ

### 4.2 Relative (Multiples) Valuation

- 🔄 **Peer Selection**: Select relevant peers with similar size, growth, and risk profile
- 🔄 **Multiple Compilation**: Compile multiples (P/E, EV/EBITDA, P/S, P/FCF) both historical and projected
- 🔄 **Price Derivation**: Apply appropriate multiple to your forecasted metric, derive implied price

### 4.3 Sum-of-the-Parts

- 🔄 **Diversified Analysis**: Value each division separately and aggregate (if applicable)

## 5. Scenario & Sensitivity Analysis

- 🔄 **Best-, Base-, and Worst-Case**: Define scenarios (e.g., high growth vs. recession vs. solicitation)
- 🔄 **Key-Variable Sensitivities**: Vary WACC ±1%, long-term growth ±0.5%, margin assumptions ±100 bps, and observe impact on target price
- 🔄 **Probability Weights**: Assign probabilities to each scenario to compute a weighted-average price target

## 6. Qualitative & Catalysts

- 🔄 **Management & Governance**: Evaluate board quality, capital-allocation track record, insider alignment
- 🔄 **Moat & Competitive Advantage**: Determine whether the company has sustainable barriers (network effects, patents, brands)
- 🔄 **Upcoming Catalysts**: List potential events (new product launches, M&A, regulatory approvals) that could re-rate the stock within T
- 🔄 **Risks & Red-Flags**: Identify execution risks, litigation, technological disruption, or financial covenants that could derail your thesis

## 7. Technical & Market Sentiment Check

- 🔄 **Price Trends & Momentum**: Review chart patterns, moving averages, volume trends to see whether market technicals align with your fundamental view
- 🔄 **Analyst Consensus**: Survey sell-side targets and compare your independent view to the consensus distribution
- 🔄 **Options & Investor Positioning**: Look at put/call skew, implied vols, insider transactions as contrarian or confirmatory signals

## 8. Benchmark & Review

- 🔄 **Cross-Check with Historical Accuracy**: Measure how previous price-target exercises performed against realized prices over similar horizons
- 🔄 **Peer Review**: Discuss your methodology and assumptions with colleagues or domain experts to surface blind spots

## 9. Final Synthesis & Recommendation

- 🔄 **Implied Return Profile**: Translate Pₜ into an annualized return (CAGR) and compare it to relevant benchmarks (index returns, bond yields)
- 🔄 **Margin of Safety**: If modeling suggests an intrinsic range, choose a target at the more conservative end to allow for forecasting error
- 🔄 **Document Assumptions**: Clearly annotate every key assumption, sensitivity, and risk in a concise investment memo

## 10. Ongoing Monitoring

- 🔄 **Watch-list**: Establish a watch-list of key triggers (earnings beats/misses, macro updates, competitor moves)
- 🔄 **Periodic Checkpoints**: Set periodic checkpoints (quarterly or semi-annual) to revisit and refresh the model, adjusting Pₜ as new information arrives

## 🎯 Main Strategy Framework

### Key Questions to Address:

1. **Price Differential Analysis**
   - How far away from the current price is the price target?
   - When thinking about the target price and the difference to the current price, we need to think if there is anything we can forecast that will justify that price move

2. **Historical Performance Context**
   - How many times has the company's stock ever achieved this price action?

3. **Market Conditions Assessment**
   - **High Price Differential** (≥20% increase/decrease):
     - How many times has the company's price action performed this way?
     - What were the market conditions during those periods?
   
   - **Low Price Differential** (≤3% increase/decrease):
     - Does the stock trade mostly sideways or show a slow climb up?
