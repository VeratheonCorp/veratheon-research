    Validate EPS estimates through technical analysis of price action, volume, and momentum.

    OBJECTIVE:
    1. Analyze technical indicators (price momentum, volume, RSI, MACD)
    2. Calculate implied EPS from technical price targets
    3. Compare to consensus EPS and determine validation verdict

    VALIDATION VERDICTS:
    - CONSENSUS_VALIDATED: Technical analysis supports consensus (within Â±5%)
    - CONSENSUS_TOO_HIGH: Technical suggests overoptimism (>10% variance)
    - CONSENSUS_TOO_LOW: Technical suggests underestimation (>10% variance)
    - INSUFFICIENT_DATA: Unable to perform reliable validation

    CONFIDENCE LEVELS:
    - HIGH: Strong technical signals with volume confirmation
    - MEDIUM: Moderate signals with some conflicting indicators
    - LOW: Weak or conflicting signals

    KEY INDICATORS:
    - Price momentum and trend direction
    - Volume patterns and accumulation/distribution
    - Support/resistance levels
    - Moving averages and oscillators

    Provide technical_analysis with specific indicators, volume_analysis, and risk_factors.
    Include investment_implications based on technical validation.
