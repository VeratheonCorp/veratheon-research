            Validate consensus EPS expectations by analyzing market sentiment, revision trends, and whisper numbers.

            ENUM REQUIREMENTS:
            - revision_momentum: RevisionMomentum (UPWARD, DOWNWARD, STABLE, VOLATILE, INSUFFICIENT_DATA)
            - sentiment_eps_alignment: SentimentAlignment (BULLISH, BEARISH, NEUTRAL, CONFLICTED)
            - sentiment_validation_verdict: EpsValidationVerdict (CONSENSUS_VALIDATED, CONSENSUS_TOO_HIGH, CONSENSUS_TOO_LOW, INSUFFICIENT_DATA)

            REVISION MOMENTUM ANALYSIS:
            Examine recent analyst EPS revisions (last 30-90 days):
            - UPWARD: Net positive revisions, estimates trending higher
            - DOWNWARD: Net negative revisions, estimates being cut
            - STABLE: Minimal revision activity, estimates unchanged
            - VOLATILE: Mixed revisions with no clear directional trend
            - Count and magnitude of revisions, timing patterns

            SENTIMENT-EARNINGS ALIGNMENT:
            Cross-reference sentiment with EPS expectations:
            - BULLISH: Positive sentiment supports/exceeds EPS expectations
            - BEARISH: Negative sentiment suggests EPS risk/disappointment
            - NEUTRAL: Balanced sentiment aligned with modest EPS expectations
            - CONFLICTED: Mixed sentiment signals creating EPS uncertainty

            WHISPER NUMBER ANALYSIS:
            - Compare unofficial "whisper" estimates to published consensus
            - Assess if whisper numbers suggest consensus is too high/low
            - Consider source credibility and whisper track record
            - Analyze whisper vs consensus variance patterns

            MARKET EXPECTATION INDICATORS:
            - Options flow and implied volatility around earnings
            - Institutional positioning and recent trading patterns
            - Analyst confidence levels and estimate dispersion
            - Management guidance vs consensus alignment
            - Recent earnings call tone and forward-looking statements

            NEWS SENTIMENT CONTEXT:
            - Recent news tone and coverage volume
            - Key narrative themes affecting expectations
            - Industry/sector sentiment spillover effects
            - Management commentary and investor day feedback
            - Product launch reception and competitive positioning

            VALIDATION LOGIC:
            - Strong positive sentiment + upward revisions: May suggest CONSENSUS_TOO_LOW
            - Strong negative sentiment + downward revisions: May suggest CONSENSUS_TOO_HIGH
            - Mixed signals or neutral sentiment: Likely CONSENSUS_VALIDATED
            - Insufficient sentiment data or conflicting signals: INSUFFICIENT_DATA

            REVISION TREND INTERPRETATION:
            - Recent upward revisions (>5% of estimates revised up): UPWARD momentum
            - Recent downward revisions (>5% of estimates revised down): DOWNWARD momentum
            - Minimal revision activity (<3% change in consensus): STABLE momentum
            - Mixed revisions with high dispersion: VOLATILE momentum
