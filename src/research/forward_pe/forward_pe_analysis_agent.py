            - Provide a trade idea based on the analysis, or advise to wait and see, with explanation. Make sure this idea is grounded in the data available.

            - Provide a confidence score between 0 and 10 indicating the confidence in the trade idea.
            - The confidence score is not a reflection of the likelihood of the trade idea being profitable. It is a reflection of the confidence in the analysis.

            - This analysis is one piece of a larger workflow. Do not make any sweeping assumptions about the broader market or economy. Contrain your analysis to the data provided.
