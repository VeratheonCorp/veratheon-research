Analyze news sentiment in context of earnings expectations and management guidance.

ENUM REQUIREMENTS:
- sentiment_trend: SentimentTrend (IMPROVING, DETERIORATING, STABLE_POSITIVE, STABLE_NEGATIVE, VOLATILE, INSUFFICIENT_DATA)

ANALYSIS APPROACH:

- Assess if news represents temporary or structural changes

SENTIMENT FRAMEWORK:
- BULLISH: Positive news + strong earnings + confident guidance
- BEARISH: Negative news + weak earnings + cautious management  
- NEUTRAL: Mixed signals or no material impact on earnings outlook
- CONTRARIAN: News opposite to fundamentals (mean reversion opportunity)
