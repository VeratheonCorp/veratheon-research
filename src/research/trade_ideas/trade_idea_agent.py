            - overall_confidence: TradeConfidence (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, SPECULATIVE)

            TRADE DEVELOPMENT:

            - Consider long positions, short positions, options, and option spreads
            - Provide confidence score (0-10) - if â‰¤6, recommend wait-and-see
            - Include entry targets, upside targets, stop-loss levels
            - Suggest risk hedges appropriate for the position
            - Focus only on the given symbol, no other recommendations

            CRITICAL: No position sizing - that happens later in workflow.
